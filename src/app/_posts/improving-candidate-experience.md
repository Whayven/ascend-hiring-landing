In today's highly competitive job market, providing an exceptional candidate experience has become a top priority for companies. According to the Talent Board Candidate Experience Benchmark Report, candidate experience is the greatest talent acquisition priority for companies in 2021. However, many organizations struggle to understand what constitutes a great candidate experience and how to achieve it. Reading this article will provide a clear plan of action for recruiters to maximize candidate experience, with insights from industry experts and a spotlight on Ascend Hiring, an AI Recruitment Platform that exemplifies a great candidate experience.

## Understanding the Importance of Candidate Experience

Candidate experience is not just a buzzword; it is a shared, connected activity that drives value for both the employer and the candidates. As Aptitude Research highlights, one in four companies are confused about what the candidate experience means at their organization, and less than 50% of companies even measure the recruiter experience. However, failing to prioritize candidate experience can have severe consequences, including damaging the company's reputation, hindering recruitment efforts, and ultimately impacting business success.

## The Five Hallmarks of an Excellent Candidate Experience

According to the Talent Board, there are five consistent hallmarks of an excellent candidate experience:

### 1. Consistent Communication

Communication should be consistent across the hiring process, from pre-application to onboarding. Companies can leverage a mix of automated tools, like Ascend Hiring's communication platform, and human interaction to improve the way they attract and engage talent.

### 2. Setting Realistic Expectations

Companies must set realistic expectations for when candidates will hear back and what is coming next in the process. This transparency builds trust and prevents frustration among candidates.

### 3. Incorporating Feedback Opportunities

Incorporating feedback opportunities makes the process more engaging and personal. Even if the feedback is negative, it increases candidates' positive impressions. Conversely, providing feedback to final-stage candidates is essential, as it lets them know why they are not moving forward.

### 4. Transparency and Accountability

The more transparent and accountable employers are with candidates, the better their experience will be, and the more they will trust the employer. Platforms like Ascend Hiring prioritize transparency throughout the recruitment process by updating applicants along the way.

### 5. Fair and Equitable Treatment

Candidates, whether accepted or rejected, should leave feeling like they were treated fairly and equitably in the decision-making process.

## Implementing a Plan of Action

To maximize candidate experience, recruiters should take the following steps:

### Conduct an audit of the current candidate experience to identify areas for improvement.

An audit of this experience would involve gathering and analyzing data on each stage of the recruitment process. This could involve surveying past candidates about their experiences, reviewing the communication process for clarity and timeliness, or analyzing the effectiveness of the recruitment channels used.

The goal of this audit is to identify any areas that may be causing frustration or dissatisfaction among candidates.
Leverage technology solutions like Ascend Hiring to streamline communication, set expectations, and provide transparency throughout the recruitment process.

### Train recruiters and hiring managers on best practices for providing feedback, setting expectations, and maintaining consistent communication

#### 1. Providing Feedback

This involves teaching recruiters and hiring managers how to give constructive and timely feedback to candidates. This could be feedback on their interview performance, their application, or the reasons behind a hiring decision. Good feedback can help candidates improve and grow, and it can also leave them with a positive impression of the company, even if they weren't selected for the position.

#### 2. Setting Expectations

This refers to clearly communicating the recruitment process, job requirements, and potential timeline to candidates. When expectations are clearly set, candidates are less likely to be disappointed or surprised by the process, which can lead to a better candidate experience.

#### 3. Maintaining Consistent Communication

This involves keeping candidates updated about their status in the recruitment process, next steps, and any changes that might occur. Consistent communication can help to build trust and respect with candidates, and it can prevent them from feeling left in the dark.

### Implement regular candidate experience surveys and use the feedback to continuously improve processes

These surveys are questionnaires that are given to candidates after they have gone through the recruitment process. They typically ask about the candidate's perceptions of various aspects of the process, such as the ease of applying, the clarity of communication, the fairness of the interview, and their overall satisfaction with the process.

The goal is to use the feedback from candidates to identify areas of dissatisfaction or frustration and make changes to address these issues.

### Prioritize fairness and equity in all decision

Fairness refers to making judgments that are free from discrimination, bias, favoritism, or self-interest. It's about making decisions that are just, equitable, and right. Equity, on the other hand, is about ensuring that everyone has access to the same opportunities. Sometimes, achieving equity requires treating people differently to account for disparities in their circumstances or abilities

### What You Can Do
